# Contributing

Thanks for helping. This file covers how to work on the package and how releases happen.

## Set up

You need Node 22.13 or later (the oldest the build and test tools install on; CI runs the unit tests on 22.13.0 as well as current Node 22) and pnpm (the version is pinned in `package.json`; `corepack enable` picks it up).

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Layout

| Path                 | What it is                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/`           | The player: Svelte components and pure modules. Shipped as source at `/svelte`.               |
| `src/lib/__tests__/` | Unit tests (Vitest, jsdom, Testing Library, jest-axe).                                        |
| `src/server.ts`      | The side-effect-free entry (`/server`). The root adds the element registration.               |
| `src/cdn/`           | The inline `load="click"` loaders (CDN and self-hosting) and the fallback stylesheet.         |
| `fixtures/fallback/` | Shared fallback markup cases, shipped for the WordPress plugin's PHP port.                    |
| `src/jsx/`           | JSX typings for React, Preact and Solid.                                                      |
| `tests/contract/`    | Tests against the built files in `dist/`.                                                     |
| `tests/browser/`     | Playwright tests in Chromium: heights, the list, the play button, mini-player and transcript. |
| `fixtures/jsx/`      | Compile-only fixtures that prove the JSX typings work.                                        |
| `scripts/`           | Build, manifest, element reference, publish and security-review tooling.                      |
| `docs/elements.md`   | The element reference, generated from `custom-elements.json` by `scripts/elements-md.mjs`.    |

## Checks

CI runs all of these on every pull request. Run them before you push:

```sh
pnpm lint            # prettier and eslint
pnpm check           # svelte-check, warnings fail
pnpm test            # unit tests
pnpm build           # everything in dist/
pnpm cem:check       # custom-elements.json matches the components
pnpm elements:check  # docs/elements.md matches custom-elements.json
pnpm test:contract   # tests against dist/
pnpm size            # v1.js within 31 kB gzipped, the list chunk within 12.7 kB, the play chunk within 10.6 kB, the transcript chunk within 15 kB; the loaders and fallback CSS within theirs
pnpm publint
pnpm attw
pnpm jsx:check
pnpm test:browser    # needs `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once
```

If you change an attribute or a `part`, run `pnpm cem` and then `pnpm elements`, and commit `custom-elements.json` and `docs/elements.md`. The manifest script fails if an attribute or part has no description, and CI fails if either file is stale (`pnpm cem:check`, `pnpm elements:check`).

When you change what an element does or which attributes it takes, update the README's tables and `llms.txt` in the same pull request.

## Rules for the player

- **v1 is a contract.** `dist/cdn/v1.js` is served to pages we cannot edit. Keep both tag names, every attribute and its behaviour, the skeleton heights and the light-DOM fallback slot. A breaking change ships as a new entry (`v2.js`), not as a change to v1.
- **Lazy chunks.** The episode list, the play button with the mini-player, and the transcript are not in `v1.js`: `vite.cdn.config.ts` splits them into `dist/cdn/chunks/episodes-[hash].js`, `dist/cdn/chunks/play-[hash].js` and `dist/cdn/chunks/transcript-[hash].js`, classic scripts that `v1.js` adds next to itself (`src/lib/lazy-element.ts`) and that share `v1.js`'s Svelte runtime. The name changes with its content, so a CDN deploy must keep the chunks of earlier builds: a page can hold a cached `v1.js` that asks for an older one. The npm root bundles the chunks, so nothing is fetched there.
- **Chunks share only `v1.js`.** Code that two chunks import and `v1.js` does not would need a third file, and the build fails if that happens. So the play and transcript chunks do not import the list's modules (`episode-list.ts`, `list-strings.ts`), and they use no Svelte feature that only the list uses, such as `{#each}` (whose runtime is in the list's chunk, not `v1.js`; the transcript draws its lines by hand). A chunk's use of a helper can also grow `v1.js`: a module `v1.js` already includes stays there whole, so a function only a chunk calls (Svelte's `bind:value`, `canOfferTranscript`) lands in `v1.js`. Check `pnpm size` for `v1.js` after any change to a chunk.
- **The height contract** (`src/lib/heights.ts`) changes only in a major version. If a change moves a rendered height, the browser test fails. The player takes the page's font, so `tests/browser/heights.spec.ts` measures the four heights in four fonts (`tests/browser/fonts.ts`); keep its type in px with unitless line heights and its titles on one line, and add a font there if a change could be sensitive to one.
- **Styling hooks.** The `--showfm-*` custom properties are public API: listed in `src/lib/style-hooks.ts`, described in `scripts/cem.mjs` and in the README table, and a test holds the three together. Add a hook to all three, and never rename or drop one within v1. Colours go through `resolvePalette()` (`src/lib/palette.ts`) by way of `createLook()` (`src/lib/look.svelte.ts`), never straight into CSS: CSS cannot check contrast. The palette tests sweep accents, surfaces and themes and require 4.5:1 for every text and background pair and 3:1 for the fill, the focus ring and the waveform; `tests/browser/hooks.spec.ts` checks the same on the computed styles of every element at three widths, in light and dark and in three fonts, and leaves a screenshot of each in `test-results/`. `tests/browser/states.spec.ts` drives every state of every element (loading, facade, errors, blocked, suspended, empty, searching, the mini-player's layouts) in four looks and fails on any text colour or background that is not the element's palette, so never write a colour into a component; add a new state there.
- **No scoping classes in the CDN build.** `vite.cdn.config.ts` drops Svelte's scoping class from the player's markup and CSS (the shadow root already keeps styles in), which keeps `v1.js` within budget. So two components that share a shadow root (`ShowfmPlayer` and `PlayerCore`) must not share a class name, and a type selector in them sits under `:where(.player)` or another class of their own.
- **Stay self-contained.** The player imports only `./` modules and Svelte. No runtime dependencies, no global CSS and no web fonts: everything lands in the public bundle. The test fonts (`@fontsource/*`) are dev dependencies the browser tests serve themselves.
- **Every visible string has a key** in `src/lib/strings.ts` (English) and `src/lib/locales/` (German and French). The CDN build bundles English only and loads the others as `dist/cdn/locales/*.js` on demand, so keep new languages out of `v1.js`. A test holds each to the design's maximum length, and the browser test renders the one-line messages in Geist at 320px.
- **No development hosts.** The package names only production hosts. A staging or development page adds its media host at runtime with `window.showfmMediaHosts`, so never build one in. `tests/contract/no-dev-hosts.test.ts` fails if a development domain appears anywhere in `dist/` or in any file `npm pack` would publish.
- **Fallback markup is a contract with the WordPress plugin.** If `src/lib/fallback.ts` changes its output, update `fixtures/fallback/` in the same pull request; the plugin's PHP port follows it.
- **Accessibility.** Every state stays axe-clean, and keyboard and screen-reader behaviour is tested.

## Changesets and releases

Every pull request that changes what the package ships needs a changeset:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the bump (patch, minor or major) and write one or two sentences for the changelog. Changes to tests, CI or docs alone do not need one.

Releases use no npm token. One step is manual: the organisation does not let GitHub Actions open pull requests, so you open the version pull request yourself.

1. When changesets reach `main`, the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) applies them, commits "Version packages" (the version bump and the changelog) and pushes the `changeset-release/main` branch.
2. The workflow then tries to open the pull request and fails with "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests". That red run is expected: the branch is already pushed.
3. Open the pull request from that branch by hand, for example `gh pr create --base main --head changeset-release/main --title "Release @showfm/embed X.Y.Z"`. Because a person opens it, CI runs on it as usual.
4. Merging it runs the release workflow again, which publishes to npm with trusted publishing (OIDC) and provenance, then tags the release and creates the GitHub release.

Trusted publishing on npmjs.com is set up for the workflow file name `release.yml`. Do not rename it.

## Security review

Add the `security-review` label to a pull request when it is ready to merge. That runs a Claude security review of the final diff. Read the verdict in the run's last step, not just the tick: the notes at the top of `.github/workflows/security-review.yml` explain why.
