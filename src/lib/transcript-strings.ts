 * The transcript's strings (design page 3, "Follow-along transcript" and

 * v1.js does not carry it; German and French are in locales/de.ts and
 * locales/fr.ts with the player's, so the CDN build loads them with the same
 * locale chunk. The transcript also uses the player's shared strings
 * (`transcript`, `suspended`, `retry`).
 *
 * The rules are the player's (strings.ts): `{name}` placeholders, and
 * `window.showfmStrings` or `element.strings` override any key.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM work at import time.
