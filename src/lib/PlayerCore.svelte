<!--
	PlayerCore — the embeddable audio player UI (AudioPlayerRedesign spec).

	Layout: FULL = identity → waveform → transport → attribution rows;
	COMPACT = artwork + [title/time row over a single transport row] + footer,
	so nothing overlaps down to ~320px. Auto light/dark resolves in JS (the
	waveform canvas needs the resolved theme), host accent via the `accent`
	attribute, `wave={false}` falls back to a plain bar + knob.

	Constraints (this component compiles into the standalone custom element):
	- Scoped hand-written CSS ONLY. No Tailwind, no app CSS, no lucide imports —
	  in shadow DOM none of those reach the component, and every dependency
	  lands in the public player bundle. Geist is a font-stack preference, not
	  a shipped webfont.
	- The waveform canvas is purely visual: the seeking control is the
	  transparent native range input overlaid on it (keyboard + aria-valuetext
	  + focus ring preserved). Accessibility is the point of this player.
