/**
 * The page audio controller: one per page, shared by every show.fm element.
 *
 * - **One plays at a time.** Every element's audio is attached here. When
 *   one starts playing, the controller pauses all the others.
 * - **One shared audio element.** Elements that have no `<audio>` of their
 *   own (the play button and the episode list, EMB-3 and EMB-4) play through
 *   `playShared`, which drives a single `HTMLAudioElement` for the page. The
 *   single player keeps its own `<audio>`, as it always has, so a page with
 *   one player behaves exactly as before.
 * - **State for subscribers.** The current episode, time, duration and
 *   playback state, for the mini-player and the transcript.
 * - **What can be followed.** Every attached audio and its episode
 *   (`audios()`), so a transcript can follow a given player, a list or
 *   whatever plays. Attaching one tells subscribers, so a transcript finds a
 *   player that loads after it.
 * - **"Powered by show.fm" once per page**, on the first embed that shows it
 *   (decisions 3 and 9). Elements claim the credit; the first claimant in
 *   document order that wants it gets it, and an earlier element still
 *   loading holds the decision so the credit never jumps on load.
 *
 * The instance lives on `globalThis` under a registered symbol, so the CDN
 * script and an npm copy on the same page share one controller.
 *
 * No DOM work at import time; the shared element is created on first use.
